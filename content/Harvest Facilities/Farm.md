The farm is build near the fields already present on the island. It has all the necessary tools for farming and ranching.

Harvest: plants and animals You commission the farm to start collecting full grown plants and animals around the farm. At the end of the bastion turn, Ayre will give you any vegetables she has collected. It is possible to replant some vegetables, having a higher chance that the next harvest will produce the same result. The farm can also produce some domesticated meat.
