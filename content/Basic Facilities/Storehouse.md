A Storehouse is a cool, dark space meant to contain objects from the Trade Goods table in chapter 7 and from chapter 6 of the Playerâ€™s Handbook.
**Trade: Goods** When you issue the Trade order to this facility, [[Facilities Keepers/Joe the Trader]] spends the next 7 days procuring nonmagical items that have a total value of 500 GP or less and stores them in the Storehouse, or [[Facilities Keepers/Joe the Trader]] uses those 7 days to sell goods in the Storehouse.

You bear the total cost of any purchases, and the maximum value of the items purchased increases to 2,000 GP when you reach *level 9* and 5,000 GP when you reach *level 13*. 
When you sell goods from your Storehouse, the buyer pays you 10 percent more than the standard price; this profit increases to 20 percent when you reach *level 9*, 50 percent when you reach *level 13*, and 100 percent when you reach level 17.
