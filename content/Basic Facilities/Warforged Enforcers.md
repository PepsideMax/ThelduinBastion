Create three warforged enforcers (warforcers), created by ancient elven magic. The warforcers will defend the bastion whenever it is under attack and uphold the law for visitors in the bastion. The warforcers will stand by as statues when there is no Threat detected. 
**Recruit:** Warforged enforcers Each time you issue the Recruit order to [[Facilities Keepers/CT-7567]], create one additional warforcer. The creation of a warforcer is 100 GP, 2 metal bars, a gem worth 25 gp at least and a use of the rune of artifical life. The bastion can hold up to six warforcers. Keep track of the warforcers housed in your Bastion. If you lose a warforcer, deduct them from your roster. Assign names and personalities to your warforcers as you see fit.
