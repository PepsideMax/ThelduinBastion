Icons of your religion are displayed in this facility, which includes a quiet place for worship.

**Sanctuary Charm.** After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 3) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast Healing Word once without expending a spell slot. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it. The Sanctuary can only give its charm once per bastion turn.

**Craft: Sacred Focus** When you issue the Craft order to this facility, you commission the [[Facilities Keepers/Antipope Felix MK.II]] to craft a Druidic Focus (wooden staff) or a Holy Symbol. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The item remains in your Bastion until you claim it.
