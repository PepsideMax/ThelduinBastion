| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Cobbler’s Tools       | Potter’s Tools     |

| Leatherworker’s Tools | Woodcarver’s Tools |
| Mason’s Tools         |                    |

**Craft Options** When you issue the Craft order to this
facility, choose one of the following options:

**Craft: Adventuring Gear** [[Facilities Keepers/Geppe The Cogworker]] crafts anything that can be made with the tools you chose when you added the Workshop to your Bastion (see above), using the rules in the Player’s Handbook.

**Craft: Magic Item (Implement)** If you are *level 9*, you can commission [[Facilities Keepers/Geppe The Cogworker]] to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the Implements tables in chapter 7. The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and [[Facilities Keepers/Geppe The Cogworker]] has proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the Arcana skill. See the “Crafting Magic Items” section in chapter 7 for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must craft the item yourself ([[Facilities Keepers/Geppe The Cogworker]] can assist), and you must, have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.
**Enlarging the Facility** You can enlarge your Workshop by spending 500 GP. If you do so, the Workshop gains three additional Artisan’s Tools (chosen from the list above).
