An Arcane Study is a place of quiet research that contains one or more desks and bookshelves.

Arcane Study Charm After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 3) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast Identify without expending a spell slot or using Material components. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it. The Arcane study can only give its charm once per bastion turn.

Craft Options. When you issue the Craft order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

- **Arcane Focus** You commission Ayre to craft an Arcane Focus. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The Arcane Focus remains in your Bastion until you claim it.
- **Book** You commission the Ayre to craft a blank book. The work takes 7 days and costs you 10 GP. The book remains in your Bastion until you claim it.
- **Magic Item** (Arcana) If you are level 9+, you can commission Ayre to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the Arcana tables in chapter 7. The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and Ayre has proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the Arcana skill. See the “Crafting Magic Items” section in chapter 7 for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item, If the item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (Ayre can assist), and you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.
