This Library contains a collection of books plus one or more desks and reading chairs.

**Research**: Topical Lore When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission Ayre to research a topic. The topic can be a legend, a known event or location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, Ayre obtains up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to you and shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with her. The DM determines what information you learn.

The keeper of the library is a [[Facilities Keepers/Book Wurm]]
