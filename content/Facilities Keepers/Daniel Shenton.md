[[Facilities Keepers/Daniel Shenton]] is the infamous halfling head of the flat planes society. Starting as a renowned astronomer he first found some strange behaviour of the stars not moving as you would expect from a round plane rotating around the sun. Once discovering this inconsistency the strange phenomenon started increasing. Trying to prove to the rest of the lands that the plane is indeed flat. He started to notice that there was a certain push back from his [[Complex Facilities/Observatory]] like the research was getting supressed suddenly not getting published on a regular basis. To spread the word he created his own organization of independent researchers. The flat plane society saw a lot of backlash from the different ruling classes eventually leaving them stranded on the astral plane as a last resort. Publishing there findings in the only independent news in the forgotten realms named [[3Mechanics/wordlbuilding/Denial News]].
