You commission ayre to build a [[Complex Facilities/Archive]] when you are contacted by a [[Facilities Keepers/Book Wurm]] guiding you to the [[Basic Facilities/Library]]. In a back corner you never notice before the book wurm nudges you to pick out a certain book sadly the book seems to be stuck. After giving it a good tug the book puls back making the entire bookshelves disappear. This new opening leads to a stairway down to a room where in the center you see a strange device labelde View-Master.
When looking in to this device you can see a world of information an knowledge. This is a incredible invention made by the [[Facilities Keepers/Book Wurm]]s that allows you to look in to the plane of knowledge.
