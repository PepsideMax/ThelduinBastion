Once you build a [[Advanced Facilities/Theater]] you will notice that there is a strange presence who seems to haunt the building. Turns out she is a ghost who ended up in the astral plane after being exorcised from the Lightsinger Theater. After so many years of watching all the performances she became an expert in the performing arts she would love to teach you and help you set up a performances to shatter the boundary between planes.
