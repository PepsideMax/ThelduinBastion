A [[3Mechanics/Bestiary/The-Book-Wurm\|Book Wurm]] is part of the great written plane a space where all the written words connect. In the past the written plane was threatened by a plague of [[3Mechanics/Bestiary/Knowledge Consumers]] witch was solved withe the aid of Ayre who managed to clear this plague. Since then every library Ayre associates with gets to collect information using this written plane only accessible to the Wurm's normally.

Wurm's can't speak they communicate only using the written word.

Book worm is the [[Basic Facilities/Library]] keeper.
