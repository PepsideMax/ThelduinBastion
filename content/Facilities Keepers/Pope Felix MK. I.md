Noticing the the scale of this new church just couldn't keep up with the soaring demand for guidance. The [[Facilities Keepers/Antipope Felix MK.IV\|Antipope's]] convened to find the perfect solution to this problem on this conclave they decided to create a [[Sophisticated Facilities/Sanctum]] with a brand new pope for the church of Gond. This venture was once again incredibly successful making Gond one of the most influential faiths in the astral plane.
