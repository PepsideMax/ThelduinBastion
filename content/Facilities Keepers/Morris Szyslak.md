Morris comes from a long line of [Rum Gremlin](Gremlin-Rum) who have natural instincts that make them the ultimate barmen. This was also noticed by [[The Doghouse]] who have a great nose fot business making him the perfect candidate to be manager in the new expansion of the [[Gaminghall]] where they thought a [[Pub]] would be a perfect addition to lure the astral costumers.
