The success of Gond kept on increasing to the point where they started creating relic grade items for the most devoted of believers. The [[Complex Facilities/Reliquary]] was created to hold these relics commissioned by [[Facilities Keepers/Antipope Felix MK.III]]. To protect the [[Complex Facilities/Reliquary]] and guide the lost believers [[Facilities Keepers/Antipope Felix MK.III]] also made a new protector/priest named [[Facilities Keepers/Antipope Felix MK.IV]].
