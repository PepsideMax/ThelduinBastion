Andre looks like a small furry dragon to most while an expert would recognize a [Kodragon](https://dungeonsdragons.fandom.com/wiki/Kodragon). Instead of scales Kodragons have a soft furry skin. While normally kodragons are connected to astral dragons Andre was banished from it's masters territory, because they where more absorbed in the crafting and creation of tools en equipment then actually doing the job they where assigned. Stranded and alone they hid in a burrow on the bastion only being awoken by the sound of steel hitting an anvil. Being drawn to Andre's true passion for the forge they offers to work in your [[Smithy]] as long as you leave them alone when working.
