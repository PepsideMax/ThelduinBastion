Skōlēx is a researcher of the arcane arts who does not feel at home with the other [[3Mechanics/Bestiary/Psurlon]] where the others where focused on taking over the astral plane fighting the [githyanki](githyanki-warrior-xmm) for dominion. Skōlēx just loved the arcane and all that is magic as long as we remain neutral in the githyanki Psurlon conflict he would love to do his research in the our [[Basic Facilities/Arcane Study]]
