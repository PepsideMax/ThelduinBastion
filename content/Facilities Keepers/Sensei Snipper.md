Sensei Snipper is a druid who was researching how to make wild shape last longer and he seems to have succeeded. The only problem is he is now stuck as a half rat half human. In his search to find a cure for his situation he followed a lot of leads to find Ayre. Once he finds her he offers to train the adventurers while he and Ayre spend time to research how to turn back. 
You can find Sensei in the [[Advanced Facilities/Training Area]].
