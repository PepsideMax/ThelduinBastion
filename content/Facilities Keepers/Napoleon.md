Napoleon is a giant pig that has been experimented on by the researcher Dr. Jones. Once he gained intelligence [[Facilities Keepers/Napoleon]] dedicated all of his time researching a way to escape. He made an elaborate plan involving a type of uprising organizing his fellow subjects. Once the uprising succeeded he found a lot of advanced research Jones already created. Tempted by these possibility's he convinced the recently freed subjects to continue the work Jones was doing. 
Now he is a multinational technologie mogul who sells patented technologie to any interested party. If you build a [[Sophisticated Facilities/Demiplane]] he will personally come to explain how it works.
