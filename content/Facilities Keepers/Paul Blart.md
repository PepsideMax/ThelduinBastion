Paul is a former [[Basic Facilities/Storehouse]] security officer who did the job with a passion for a long time building a reputation in the industry as one of the best around. The idea of a possible change suddenly came when he found a flyer looking of help in a new [[Complex Facilities/Menagerie]]. Seeing this as the perfect opportunity for change he applied as soon as possible and made his way to the astral plane.
