Found on docks and ships, these small, pot-bellied monstrosities have bright green hair, orange eyes, and a drunken stare. They are only a foot tall and weigh ten lb, but they are renowned for causing mischief far beyond their tiny size. Their mouths are filled with razor-sharp teeth.

**Drunken Aura.** Rum gremlins make their homes near the docks of seaside towns and some are known to stow away on ships. Each rum gremlin radiates a magic aura causing drunkenness affecting any creatures in the area. Those affected find it difficult to stay on their feet and may become sick from the effect.

**Sailor Victims.** The little horrors often create distracting sounds and small traps. Rum gremlins prey on sailors and dockworkers, working in groups to swarm affected victims who they drag into their lairs below docks or in the holds of ships. They also take great delight in the collateral damage their magic can wreak, frequently sparking accusations and quarrels in places they inhabit before picking off isolated victims.

**Rat Friends.** Rum gremlins are often found with rat swarms or doppelrats they have trained to help protect their nests. The sound of bells drives rum gremlins into a rage and they will go to great lengths to destroy the source of their torment.
