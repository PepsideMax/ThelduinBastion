The herb orchard is build on the fertile ground left behind by the overgrowth. No one knows what might grow from this ground.

**Harvest: herbs** You commission [[content/Facilities Keepers/Peony Misplacer]] to start collecting. At the end of the bastion turn, [[content/Facilities Keepers/Peony Misplacer]] will give you any herbs it has collected. There is a change to grow rare herbs. It is possible to replant some herbs, having a higher chance that the next harvest will produce the same result.
