The Theater contains a stage, a backstage area where props and sets are kept, and a seating area for a small audience.

**Empower: Theatrical Event** When you issue the Empower order to this facility, [[content/Facilities Keepers/Wendy, The Weeping Artist]] begins work on a theatrical production or concert. Rehearsals and other preparations take 14 days, followed by at least 7 days of performances. The performances can continue
indefinitely until a new production gets underway. You or another character can contribute to a production in the following ways:
*Composer/Writer* A character can compose music or write a script for a concert or production that hasn’t started rehearsals yet. This effort takes 14 days.
*Conductor/Director* A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the production can serve as the concert’s conductor or the production’s director.
*Performer* A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the rehearsal period can be a star performer in one or more of the performances.

At the end of a rehearsal period, each character who contributed to the concert or production can make a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check. If more of these checks succeed than fail, you and any other character who contributed to the concert become inspired for one week. When receiving the inspired condition and after each long rest, you receive 1d6 theater die. You can roll this die when rolling any d20 check and add the theater die’s result to the roll. 
Empowering this facility again can repreform a production that is already rehearsed, allowing any contributors to receive the inspired condition again.

**Enlarging the Facility** You can enlarge your theater by spending 2000 GP. If you do so, the theater die becomes a 1D8. Enlarging it even further by spending 3000 GP grants a D10 theater die.
