Sensei Snipper is a druid who was researching how to make wild shape last longer and he seems to have succeeded. The only problem is he is now stuck as a half rat half human. In his search to find a cure for his situation he followed a lot of leads to find Ayre. Once he finds her he offers to train the adventurers while he and Ayre spend time to research how to turn back.
