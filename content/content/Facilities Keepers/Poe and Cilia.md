Poe the fisher [Chwinga](chwinga-astronaut-bam) riding his [Space guppy](space-guppy-bam) Cilia Poe is like a typical [Chwinga](chwinga-astronaut-bam) very shy and seclusive liking to just chill and fish near your river getting noticed by Ayre she knew they liked to just hang out and be left alone so if you want good fish leave him lone otherwise Poe might decide to fish somewhere else in the vast astral plane.

you meet Poe once there is a [[content/Harvest Facilities/Fishing Hut]] in your bastion
