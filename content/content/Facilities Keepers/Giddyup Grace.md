Grace is a former adventurer horse, she traveled far and wide slaying monsters large and small. Taking contracts from noblemen and merchants sadly on her last contract in the forest around Frence hunting a giant ape she ended up taking an arrow to the knee. This wound ended up decommissioning her for a long time. This time made her realize it wasn't worth it to continue this danger filled adventuring lifestyle. she considered becoming a guard in one of the bigger city's of Thelduin when encountering Ayre who offered her a job as [[content/Advanced Facilities/Stable]]master for the bastion where she now gladly spends her time tending to the horses.
