A Bastion can have more than one Garden. Each time you add a Garden to your Bastion, choose its type from the options in the Garden Types table. While in your Bastion, you can instruct the facilityâ€™s hireling to change the Garden from one type to another. This work takes 21 days, during which time no other activity can occur in this facility.

**Harvest:** Garden Growth When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, you commission [[content/Facilities Keepers/Lady Glamis]] to collect items from the Garden as noted in the Garden Types table. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.

**Enlarging the Facility:** You can enlarge your Garden by spending 2,000 GP. A large Garden is equivalent to two Gardens and can include two of the same type of Garden or two different types. When you issue the Harvest order to a Large Garden, each component garden produces its own harvest. A Large Garden gains one additional hireling.
