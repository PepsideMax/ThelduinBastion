**Research**: Topical Lore When you issue the Research order to this facility, you commission [[content/Facilities Keepers/Book Wurm]] to research a topic. The topic can be a legend, a known event or location, a person of significance, a type of creature, or a famous object. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, [[content/Facilities Keepers/Book Wurm]] obtains up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to you and shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with her. The DM determines what information you learn.
