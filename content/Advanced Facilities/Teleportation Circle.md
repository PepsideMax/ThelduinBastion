**Empower: Tethered Astral portal** When you issue the empower order to this facility it allows [[Facilities Keepers/Hallinskidi]] to open a portal that teleport anyone to a different place in the astral realm. This teleport can be used to hunt down rare beast only found in the astral realm, or to take out a hostile outpost to reduce aggression to the Bastion. Any loot found in the astral realm can be brought over to the material plane. 
Each creature that uses the portal is is tethered by a magical string. The portal closes after 24h, pulling any tethered creatures back to the bastion. [[Facilities Keepers/Hallinskidi]] can use a ritual to close the portal from anywhere in the astral realm.
