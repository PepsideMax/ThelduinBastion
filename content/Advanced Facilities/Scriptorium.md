**Craft: Spell Scroll** You commission [[The Folded Ferret]] to scribe a Spell Scroll containing one Cleric or Wizard spell of level 3 or lower. The facility has the necessary Calligrapher’s Supplies, and [[The Folded Ferret]] meets all the prerequisites needed to scribe the scroll. The “Crafting Equipment” section in the Player’s Handbook specifies the time needed to scribe the scroll and the cost of the scroll, which you must pay.

The work takes 7 days and costs you 1 GP per copy. At no additional cost in time or money, [[The Folded Ferret]] can distribute the paperwork to one location across Thelduïn.
