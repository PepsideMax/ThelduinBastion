**Fruit of Restoration** One plant in your Greenhouse has three magical fruits growing on it. Any creature that eats one of these fruits gains the benefit of a Lesser Restoration spell. Fruits that aren’t eaten within 24 hours of being picked lose their magic. The plant
replaces all picked fruits each bastion turn, and it can’t be transplanted without killing it.

**Harvest Options** When you issue the Harvest order to this facility, choose one of the following options:
**Harvest: Healing Herbs** You commission [[Ruderalis]] to harvest healing herbs used to create a greater potion of healing. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.

Blood, Malice, Pale Tincture, or Truth Serum. See “Poison’ in chapter 3 for each poison’s effect. Once harvested, the poison can be contained in a vial. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. [Rework]
