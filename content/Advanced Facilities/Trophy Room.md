**Research Options** When you issue the Research order to this facility, choose one of the following options:
**Research: Lore** You commission [[Facilities Keepers/Wolothamp Geddarm]] to research a topic of your choice. The topic can be a legend, any kind of creature, or a famous object. The topic need not be directly related to items on display in the room, as the trophies provide clues to research a wide variety of other subjects. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, [[Facilities Keepers/Wolothamp Geddarm]] obtains up to three accurate pieces of information about the topic that were previously unknown to you and shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them. The DM determines what information is learned. The information is more accurate the more trophies are displayed.
**Research: Trinket Trophy** You commission [[Facilities Keepers/Wolothamp Geddarm]] to search for a trinket that might be of use to you. The work takes 7 days. When the research concludes, roll any die. If the number rolled is odd, [[Facilities Keepers/Wolothamp Geddarm]] finds nothing useful. If the number rolled is even, [[Facilities Keepers/Wolothamp Geddarm]] might finds a magic item. The DM determines what item you receive.
