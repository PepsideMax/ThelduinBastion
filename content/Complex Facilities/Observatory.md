Situated atop your Bastion, your Observatory contains a telescope aimed at the night sky.

**Observatory Charm.** You can use your Observatory to peer into the far corners of Wildspace and the Astral Plane. After spending a Long Rest in your Observatory, you gain a magical Charm (see “Supernatural Gifts” in chapter 3) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast Contact Other Plane without expending a spell slot. You can’t gain this Charm again while you still have it. The Observatory can only give its
charm once per bastion turn.

**Empower: Eldritch Discovery** When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you enable yourself or [[Facilities Keepers/Daniel Shenton]] to explore the eldritch mysteries of the stars for 7 consecutive nights. At the end of that time, roll a die. If the number rolled is even, nothing is gained. If the
number rolled is odd, an unknown power bestows one of the following [[3Mechanics/CLI/Charms]] on you or another creature of your choice that is on the same plane of existence as you: [[3Mechanics/CLI/rewards/Charm of Darkvision]], [[3Mechanics/CLI/rewards/Charm of Heroism]], or [[3Mechanics/CLI/rewards/Charm of Vitality]].
