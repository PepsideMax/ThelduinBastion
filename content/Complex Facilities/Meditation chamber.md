A Meditation Chamber is a relaxing space that helps align oneâ€™s mind, body, and spirit.

**Empower: Fortify Self** You can meditate in this facility for 1 day. If you leave the Bastion during this time, you gain no benefit. Otherwise, at the end of the day, you gain proficiency or expertise in one kind of saving throws for the next 2 day, determined randomly by rolling
on the table below. Gain a second one if this facility is empowered. Reroll if you get a duplicate result. You cannot fortify self more than once every bastion turn.
