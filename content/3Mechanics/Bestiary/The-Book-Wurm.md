# [[3Mechanics/Bestiary/The-Book-Wurm\|The Book Wurm]]
This peculiar critter is the smallest. yet most cunning
representative Of the highly venomous wurm genus. With
its remarkable ability to perfectly imitate a sheet of paper,
it secretly roams wherever books are present - from the
dust-ridden library an ancient civilization of the buzzing
book shop selling heavy tomes and fantastic scrolls.
Being able to remain motionless ever extended periods
time, it is not this whimsical creature to
be utilized for a hasty note. a secret message or a cheesy
poem Of love â€” completely unnoticed by the unwary
author.
**Living scripts:** Book Wurms can live up to several
centuries. The oldest ones are often covered in countless
potentially bearing the knowledge from long-forgotten times.

damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. Also on success, the target loses one Poison
Mark. A Poison Mark can be removed by protection from poison spell or similar magic.
