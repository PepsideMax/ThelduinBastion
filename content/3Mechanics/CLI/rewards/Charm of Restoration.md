This Charm has 3 charges. You can expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells: [Greater Restoration](/3Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md) (2 charges) or [Lesser Restoration](/3Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration-xphb.md) (1 charge). Once all its charges have been expended, the Charm vanishes from you.
