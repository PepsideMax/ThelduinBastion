*A Sanctum is a place of solace and healing.*

**Sanctum Charm** After spending a *Long Rest* in your Bastion, you gain a magical [[3Mechanics/CLI/Charms\|Charm]] that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The [[3Mechanics/CLI/Charms\|Charm]] allows you to cast [[3Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal-xphb\|Heal]] once without expending a spell slot. You can’t gain this [[3Mechanics/CLI/Charms\|Charm]] again while you still have it. The sanctum can only give its [[3Mechanics/CLI/Charms\|charm]] once per bastion turn.

**Empower: Fortifying Rites.** When you issue the Empower order to this facility, you inspire [[Facilities Keepers/Pope Felix MK. I]] to perform daily rites that benefit you or another character you name. The beneficiary doesn’t need to be in the Bastion when the rites are performed to gain their benefit. Each time the beneficiary finishes a Long Rest, they gain *Temporary Hit Points* equal to your level. This effect lasts for 7 days.

**Sanctum Recall** While the Sanctum exists, you always have the [[3Mechanics/CLI/spells/word-of-recall-xphb\|Word of Recall]] spell prepared. Whenever you cast [[3Mechanics/CLI/spells/word-of-recall-xphb\|Word of Recall]], you can make your Sanctum the destination of the spell instead of another place you have previously designated. In addition, one creature of your choice that arrives in the Sanctum via this spell gains the benefit of a [[3Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal-xphb\|Heal]] spell.
