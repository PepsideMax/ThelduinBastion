A door up to 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall appears on a flat, solid surface in one of the other facilities in your Bastion. You choose the location. If you are in your Bastion during a Bastion turn, you can relocate this door to another facility in your Bastion. 
Only you and [[Facilities Keepers/Napoleon]] can open the door, which leads to a Demiplane that takes the form of a stone room. The Demiplane exists in an extradimensional space and therefore isn’t attached physically to other locations in your Bastion, Neither the Demiplane nor its door can be dispelled.

**Empower: Arcane Resilience** When you issue the Empower order to this facility, [[Facilities Keepers/Napoleon]] causes magical runes appear on the Demiplane’s walls and last for 7 days. Until the runes disappear, you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to five times your level after spending an
entire Long Rest in the Demiplane.
**Fabrication** While in the Demiplane, you can take a Magic action to create a nonmagical object of your choice from nothing, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space in the Demiplane. The object can be no bigger than 5 feet in any dimension; can’t have a value over 5 GP; and must be made of wood, stone, clay, porcelain, glass, paper, nonprecious crystal, or nonprecious metal. You must finish a Long Rest before you can take this action again.
