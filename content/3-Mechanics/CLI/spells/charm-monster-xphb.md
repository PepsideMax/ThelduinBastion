One creature you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [Advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The [Charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) creature is Friendly to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [Charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) by you.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
