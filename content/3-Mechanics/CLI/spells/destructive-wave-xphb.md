# Destructive Wave
*5th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Sphere)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Destructive energy ripples outward from you in a 30-foot Emanation. Each creature you choose in the Emanation makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `dice:5d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d6`) Thunder damage and `dice:5d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`5d6`) Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) and has the [Prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

**Classes**: [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
