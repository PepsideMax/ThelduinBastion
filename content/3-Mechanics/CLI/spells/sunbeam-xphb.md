# Sunbeam
*6th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line. Each creature in the Line makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice:6d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`6d8`) Radiant damage and has the [Blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded) condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [Magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to create a new Line of radiance.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds [Bright Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius and [Dim Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

**Classes**: [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
