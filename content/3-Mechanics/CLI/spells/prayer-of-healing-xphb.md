# Prayer of Healing
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to five creatures of your choice who remain within range for the spell's entire casting gain the benefits of a [Short Rest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) and also regain `dice:2d8|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d8`) [Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). A creature can't be affected by this spell again until that creature finishes a [Long Rest](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by `dice:1d8|noform|noparens|avg|text(d8)` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
