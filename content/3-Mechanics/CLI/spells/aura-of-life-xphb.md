*4th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot Emanation for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have [Resistance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Necrotic damage, and your [Hit Point](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximums can't be reduced. If an ally with 0 [Hit Points](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) starts its turn in the aura, that ally regains 1 [Hit Point](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md).

**Classes**: [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Cleric (Life Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-life-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
