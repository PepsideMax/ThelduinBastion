# Dissonant Whispers
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice:3d6|noform|noparens|avg` (`3d6`) Psychic damage and must immediately use its [Reaction](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md), if available, to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `dice:1d6|noform|noparens|avg|text(d6)` for each spell slot level above 1.
