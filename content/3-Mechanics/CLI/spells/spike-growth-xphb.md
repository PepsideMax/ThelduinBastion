# Spike Growth
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (seven thorns)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes [Difficult Terrain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes `dice:2d4|noform|noparens|avg` (`2d4`) Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a [Search](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Search) action and succeed on a Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](/3-Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Survival)) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

**Classes**: [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
